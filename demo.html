		<!-- demo features-->
		<div style="text-align:center;font-size:30px"> Demo Features</div>
		<p>Bellow we provide a list of elements, which help to illustrate the functionality of Feature Usage Explorer. 
		First, you have to open the console of your browser. Then, you should see the list of features that were automatically identified by the tool:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Path: html > body: div Feature name: double click div</li>
			<li>Path: html > body: a Feature name: simple ancor</li>
			<li>Path: html > body: a Feature name: ancor with title </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Notice that button with no event attached "no onclick button" was not identified, because it does not change the state of the system when user clicks on it. 
		Furthermore, when you click or double click on the remaining elements then the event is registered and it is outputted to the console. </p>
		<div ondblclick="return;">double click div</div>
		<button>no onclick button</button> <br/>
		<a href="#">simple ancor</a> <br/>
		<a href="#" title="ancor with title">ancor with title</a>
		<!-- end demo features-->
		<p>The user of the Feature Usage Explorer library should decide, which information about the features is important for his/her purposes. Then, such information should be sent to the preferred data storage by substituting console output with ajax call to the selected server. 
		Finally, if the user is interested to visualise the collected information in Feature Usage Diagram, he should write a parser, which generates required json specified in the <a href="https://github.com/smarciuska/feature-usage-explorer/blob/master/UserManual.pdf">manual</a>. 
		The demo parser is available in the <a href="#">repository</a> of the Feature Usage Explorer.</p>
		<!-- feature usage diagram canvas goes here. It must have id="canvas"-->
		<p>Bellow the Feature Usage Diagram is automatically generated from a <a href="http://featurereduction.org/json-demo/getjson.php">demo json file</a>.</p>
		<div style="text-align:center;font-size:30px"> Feature Usage Diagram</div>
		<canvas id="canvas" width="2000" height="1000"></canvas>
